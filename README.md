### Hi there! 👋
**I'm [Jia Long](https://xlbgh.github.io/), a software engineer and artificial intelligence student from Tilburg, the Netherlands**

👨‍💻 I'm currently educating myself on web development for a personal project

💡 I'm primarily interested in **user-centric data-driven problem solving** where I utilise technology, from UX/UI to AI, to create products that solve them

🌱 I'm currently looking for career & growth opportunities in product management, UX/UI, data science, machine learning and software development

🌍 Outside of my studies, I'm interested in following the developments of science and state-of-the-art technologies from Formula 1 to AI

🧠 I also really enjoy deepdiving into videography, utilising visual and audio design to enhance the user experience visually and emotionally

**Let's connect!**
